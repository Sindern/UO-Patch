UO-Patch
========

A patching system for Ultima Online private shards to update users' data files.

Releasing it now unmodified.  This is the system we used at Imagine Nation ( http://in-uo.net ).

All the links are hard-coded in and I plan on converting them over to being configurable via a .ini file as soon as I get some time and feel like tinkering with AutoIt again. :)

If I recall correctly, there are a few extra libraries that are needed to compile the code.  I don't remember what they are, but I'll add links to them as I revise the code.
